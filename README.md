# SQL_PROJECTS

Let's assume that the CEO of company has asked us to check the details related to this Texture sales. So we are using SQL here.
We will try to find out answers for the below question:
--What was the total quantity sold for all products?
--which product has been sold most--
-What is the total generated revenue for all products before discounts?--
--What was the total discount amount for all products?--
--How many unique transactions were there?--
--What are the top 3 products by total revenue before discount?--
--What is the top selling product for each category?
--What is the top selling product for each segment?
--What is the average discount value per transaction?--
--What are the average unique products purchased in each transaction?--

We will examine the sales insights in this case study. For our analysis, we are utilising SQL to respond to the following questions from our stakeholders:
--List the names and kinds of every customer.
--Get the classifications of all the product codes.
--Determine the overall sales volume and sales for each product category.
--Count the number of transactions and the total sales for each year.
--Calculate the average sales volume and sales volume by customer type.
--Find the names and categories of each customer, as well as the total number of sales and the amount of sales for each.
--Obtain the brand names, volume of sales, and dollar amount of each transaction's sales.
--List all transactions together with the product, market, and client names.
--Determine the total sales for each month over the course of a given year.
